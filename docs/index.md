# Welcome to CodeDuet documentation

This documentation provides a comprehensive guide to installing, using, and developing CodeDuet. This tool lets you interact with AI models through a command-line interface.

## Overview

CodeDuet brings the capabilities of advanced AI models to your terminal in an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) environment. CodeDuet consists of a client-side application (`packages/cli`) that communicates with a local server (`packages/core`). CodeDuet also contains a variety of tools for tasks such as performing file system operations, running shells, and web fetching, which are managed by `packages/core`.

## Multi-Provider Support

CodeDuet supports multiple AI providers for maximum flexibility:

- **üÜì Local Models**: Ollama and LM Studio for completely free, private inference
- **‚òÅÔ∏è Cloud Providers**: OpenAI, Anthropic, RunPod for scalable AI access  
- **üîß Legacy Support**: Qwen OAuth, Google Gemini, Vertex AI

See the [Provider Setup Guide](../PROVIDER_SETUP.md) for detailed configuration instructions.
